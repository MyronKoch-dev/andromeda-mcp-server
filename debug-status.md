ðŸ”§ PHASE 7 DEBUG LOGGING APPLIED

## Debug Logging Added To:

### Index.ts (Schema Parsing Level):
âœ… transfer_tokens - Traces mnemonic after schema parsing
âœ… place_auction_bid - Traces mnemonic after schema parsing  
âœ… get_wallet_address - Traces mnemonic after schema parsing (WORKING)

### Server.ts (Method Level):
âœ… transferTokens - Traces mnemonic at method entry
âœ… placeAuctionBid - Traces mnemonic at method entry
âœ… auctionPlaceBid - Traces mnemonic at method entry
âœ… getWalletAddress - Traces mnemonic at method entry (WORKING)

## Expected Debug Output:
When the bug occurs, we should see:
- INDEX DEBUG: "24 words" (if schema parsing works)
- SERVER DEBUG: "1 word" (if truncation happens between calls)

OR:
- INDEX DEBUG: "1 word" (if schema parsing breaks)
- SERVER DEBUG: "1 word" (confirming schema issue)

## Next Steps:
1. Restart MCP server to load debug logging
2. Test transfer_tokens with 24-word mnemonic
3. Analyze debug output to pinpoint truncation location
4. Apply targeted fix based on findings

Ready for testing! ðŸš€
